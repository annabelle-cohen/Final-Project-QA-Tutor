## QA-Tutor

My final project in the software engineering degree (chosen to participate in exhibition of outstanding projects for 2020). 
Development of learning management system (LMS) to help junior QA to practice and 
run tests on e-commerce website. The system aims to provide the admin and the 
student control over the learning progress. 
System contains Admin interface that enables allocation of bugs to each student and 
tracking bug fixed flow. The user interface simulates a real e-commerce website with 
embedded bugs and errors for the student to find and report. 
The system has an advanced feather to practice different levels of bugs such as 
functional, DB, regression, etc. 
System developed on AWS using the following software and tools:

## Frontend:
React.js , React Hooks, React Redux, HTML, CSS, Prime React , Material UI, Materialize CSS.
